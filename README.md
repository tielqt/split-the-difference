# Split the Difference
Split the Difference allows you to calculate the difference between two split times. Designed for speedrunners. It has been implemented as a basic html and javascript page with no additional styling, allowing for the basic work to be done even though it doesn't look pretty.

Open to PRs or suggestions for designs, and I'll likely add a basic style set in the future.
